IntroductionStatus.io API v2INTRODUCTIONWelcome to the official status.io API. We built this API to help you integrate your existing tools with your status page.If you're interested in automating your status page, you're at the right place :-]Live SandboxSign in to your GitHub, Twitter or Apiary account to test and debug each API call using the Traffic Inspector.Caution: These are real API calls and will modify your status page. We recommend that you create another account at Status.io for testing purposes.Best PracticesAuthenticationInclude x-api-id and x-api-key in the header of every request.View your API credentials by clicking the API tab in the Dashboard.Note: Each team member has their own unique API credentials.Error HandlingEvery request returns a status element. Check the status.error value for yes or no.Error messages are available in status.message.Success Example{"status": { "error": "no", "message": "OK" } }Fail Example{"status": { "error": "yes", "message": "Authentication failed" } }Invalid URLsIf an invalid URL or method is called, the API will respond with a Forbidden error.Validation ErrorIf the input parameters are incorrect types, the API will respond with a Bad Request error.Data FormatWe currently utilize JSON for all requests and responses. Include application/json in the Content-Type header.Dates and TimesAll timestamps are in UTC. Custom time zone settings are applied automatically for users viewing the status page.Use CachingWe recommend that you do all API requests on the server side, and if possible cache them. If you get any substantial traffic, you do not want to call the API each time you get a page hit, since this may cause your connection to be throttled faster than expected. In general, whenever you can cache data, do so.Use Common SenseShould be simple enough. For example, don't check for the status of a component every other second. The highest resolution is one minute. Checking more often than that won't give you much of an advantage and will likely cause your connection to be throttled.Excessive repeated requests will be blocked. For instance, don't repeatedly update the status of a component that is operational. Only send status updates when the actual status changes.When bulk-submitting URLs, for cases such as adding subscribers, make sure you wait 1 second between consecutive requests.The Internet is unreliableNetworks in general are unreliable, and particularly one as large and complex as the Internet. Your application should not assume it will get an answer. There may be timeouts.Client LibrariesGo - https://github.com/statusio/statusio-goNode.js - https://github.com/statusio/statusio-nodePHP - https://github.com/statusio/statusio-phpPython - https://github.com/statusio/statusio-pythonRuby - https://github.com/statusio/statusio-rubyRust - https://github.com/SecurityInsanity/statusio (Unofficial library.
